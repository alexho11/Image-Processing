# Image-Processing
This repository contains the code and report of exercises in Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Image Processing for 1. Semster of study program ESPACE.

### Exercise 1
This exercise aims to understand the basic image characteristics histogram, mean, std etc. A second task is to use a template to find the right target in the object image which is the maximum of the correlation coefficient.


## Exercise 2
We sampled first a subimage from a given image and located three points in the subimage using image coordinates. Then we calculated the UTM coordinates of these three points with the scale and translation relationship. IN the second task, we implemented the median filter and interpretated its advantages and disadvantages compare to a mean filter. In the third task, we implemented the Sobel and Laplace filter to detect edges in the images.
